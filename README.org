  Lisp/Hiccup style templating for Facebook's [[http://facebook.github.io/react][React]] in [[https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript][ClojureScript]].

** Dependencies

   /Ŝablono/ doesn't declare a dependency on React anymore. Use the
   React dependencies from one of the ClojureScript wrappers or
   provide the dependencies yourself like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure :exports code :results silent
    [cljsjs/react "15.2.1-1"]
    [cljsjs/react-dom "15.2.1-1"]
   #+END_SRC

   If you want to do server rendering and use the =render= or
   =render-static= functions from the =sablono.server= namespace you
   need to add the following dependency as well:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure :exports code :results silent
    [cljsjs/react-dom-server "15.2.1-1"]
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

   Most functions from [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][Hiccup]] are provided in the =sablono.core=
   namespace. The library can be used with [[https://github.com/swannodette/om][Om]] like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure :exports code :results silent
    (ns example
      (:require [om.core :as om :include-macros true]
                [sablono.core :as html :refer-macros [html]]))

    (defn widget [data]
      (om/component
       (html [:div "Hello world!"
              [:ul (for [n (range 1 10)]
                     [:li {:key n} n])]
              (html/submit-button "React!")])))

    (om/root widget {} {:target (. js/document (getElementById "my-app"))})
   #+END_SRC

** HTML Tags

   /Ŝablono/ only supports tags and attributes that can be handled by
   React. This means you can't have your own custom tags and
   attributes at the moment. For more details take a look at the [[http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html][Tags
   and Attributes]] section in the React documentation.

** HTML Attributes

   HTML attributes in [[http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html#html-attributes][React]] are camel-cased and the =class= and =for=
   attributes are treated special. /Ŝablono/ renames attributes with
   dashes in their name to the camel-cased version and handles the
   =class= and =for= special case. This is more consistent with [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][Hiccup]]
   and naming conventions used in Clojure.

   An =input= element with event listeners attached to it would look
   like this in /Ŝablono/:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure :exports code :results silent
    (html [:input
           {:auto-complete "off"
            :class "autocomplete"
            :on-change #(on-change %1)
            :on-key-down #(on-key-down %1)
            :type "text"}])
   #+END_SRC

** Setting innerHTML of a DOM node

   It is not recommended to directly set the innerHTML of DOM nodes,
   but in some cases it is necessary. i.e. injecting a HTML string
   that was generated from Markdown.

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure :exports code :results silent
    (html [:div {:dangerouslySetInnerHTML {:__html "<div>hello world</div>" }}])
   #+END_SRC
